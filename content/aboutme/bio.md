## Bio
<hr size=6>
<br>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Resource Management and Environmental Studies at the University of British Columbia ([UBC](ires.ubc.ca/)) working with [Dr. Navin Ramankutty.](http://ires.ubc.ca/person/navin-ramankutty/)<br><br>
Through my research, I use [data science techniques](https://vinnyricciardi.github.io/aboutme/curriculumvitae/) to provide robust statistics about our global food system that hopefully will inform policy decisions and monitoring.
<br><br>
Currently, I am interested in synthesizing our scientific knowledge to better understand the role of 
small-scale food producers ([smallholders](http://localhost:8000/smallholders/Global_production/index.html)) in our global food system. My interests in our food system stems from growing up running around the little farms in rural New England and my past on-the-ground and often community based work with farmers and the urban hungry. 
<br><br>
For the past eight years, I was a research consultant with government ministries, NGOs, and universities throughout Southeast Asia, Ghana, and India on agricultural development issues. My work has been funded through organizations such as USAID, 
the World Bank, the National Science Foundation, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council 
(SSHRC) of Canada. In 2014, I received an M.Sc. in Geography from the Pennsylvania State University 
working with [Dr. Petra Tschakert.](http://www.web.uwa.edu.au/person/petra.tschakert)
<br><br>
When I'm not working, you can usually find me unicycling, mt. biking, cooking, or wandering the woods with my awesome partner Page and our pup Ralph.<br><br>
