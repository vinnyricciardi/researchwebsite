## Bio
<hr size=6>
<br>

Field scientist turned data scientist with a knack for sustainability. Keen interest in communicating data insights to decision makers and the general public. Fast learner with strong quantitative skillsets. 
<br><br>
My training in geography (MSc), resource management and environmental studies (PhD) has enabled me to work throughout the data pipeline. For the past nine years, I have collected primary field data, compiled and managed global-scale databases, led analyses for a wide range of stakeholders and published in high-impact academic journals.
<br><br>
Projects have focused on text-analysis, inferential statistics, machine learning, spatial analysis, and meta-analyses. I am well-versed in R (7 yrs) and Python (4 yrs) but like to tinker in JavaScript and HTML. Proponent of open-source code, tools, and systems. 
<br><br>
When I'm not working, you can usually find me unicycling, mt. biking, cooking, or wandering the woods with my awesome partner Page and our pup Ralph.<br><br>
