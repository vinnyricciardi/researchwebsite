## About Dishing Data
<hr size=6>
<br>

Welcome to dishing data! This site shares my research on our global food system 
and tech tips I run into while tinkering with code. 

Through my research, I use data science techniques to provide robust statistics about our global food 
system that hopefully will inform policy decisions and monitoring. These methods include harmonizing 
global datasets, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), web-scraping, meta-analysis, network analysis, 
inferential stats, predictive modeling, and machine learning. 

On this site, I try to write short and sweet tutorials and blog posts about my tech finds, and will be 
posting my reserach code notebooks with links to the publications they helped write. Hopefully, policy 
makers, food system advocates, data scientists, and whomever you may be will find this site useful.

This site is also where I try out new tools. Sorry in advance if there are some bugs floating around!
