## Colours of Food Security

<br><br>

The [Colours of Food Security](https://www.colours-of-food-security.com/exhibition/a-cultivated-planet/) is a series of striking images that use colour and data-driven visualization of decades of scientific research  to paint a picture of the global food system today. These data have  enabled the undertaking of a broad range of policy analyses on the problems inherent in the way agriculture operates on a global scale.  They have been used by a range of scientists, governments, NGOs, and food activists, and are featured in a wide range of news outlets and  media, including National Geographic Magazine, The New York Times, and  The Economist. The research underlying this exhibit helps to inform decision-making and solutions towards a more sustainable future. 

This project was a large collaborative effort that I helped support. For full acknowledgements please visit the exhibit's [about](https://www.colours-of-food-security.com/about/) page.
