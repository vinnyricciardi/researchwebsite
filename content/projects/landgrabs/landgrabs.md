## Mapping Global Land Reform and Tenure News

<br><br>

This map shows news articles coded as land tenure or land reform from January 2013 to October 2018. Articles were queried using the amazing [GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) project, which streams news articles from over 100 countries every 15 minutes and codes them into events, actors, locations, and sentiments (e.g., the tone of the article). This map, made with Google BigQuery and CartoDB, is in beta to give a picture of what GDELT can do for the land grab monitoring community.
