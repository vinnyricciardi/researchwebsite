To Do's:
- Make 'smallholders' link to all articles - use 'smallhodler' tag to implement
- Fix .ipynb titles so they don't show (they show 2x now since ref in doc - sed replace in doc?)
- Fix .ipynb conversion. Presently, 'Trusted' feature does not render (e.g. {variable})
- Test bokeh interactivity
- Complete CV in markdown - mulitple sections. Add css to md file?
