Summary:

## Examining the food security, climate resilience, and equity implications of farm size.

The farm size project is my doctoral dissertation. Essentially, my team and I are trying to scale up our understanding of smallholders by answering four questions at either the global of regional scales.<br><br>

### Motivation

- Farm size is getting bigger in high-income countries areas and smaller in low-income countries
< Show side by side pics of large and small farm landscape >
<!--- How many people hungry. Percentage of hungry as small farmers-->

- What does this trend mean?
- How does this trend affect our food supply, food producers, and the environment?
	- Q1: What do we know about farm size?<br>
	< Side by side pics of largeholders and smallholders at work ><br>
	< Link shows shiny app with results >
	- Q2: How much food comes from small farms?
		- Are large farms producing biofuels, or other products? Are small farms producing more food?
		- How can we produce a greater diversity of foods?<br>
		< SDG chart highlighting target 2.3 ><br>
		< Link shows main results: food by farm size, food, feed, other within each farm size, crop diversity by farm size >
	- Q3: How safe are smaller farms from climate change?<br>
		< Map of INDCs smallholder adaptation mentions by country ><br>
		< Link shows main results... >
	
	- Q4: Are smaller farms' production practices helping or hindering their resilience and environmental impact?<br>

### An Academic Background

The question of optimal farm size has animated debates in the agricultural development literature since the early-twentieth century, with environmentalists, agronomists, and economists touting the biodiversity, productivity, and resilience benefits of smallholder systems (Chayanov 1926; Balfour 1950; Sen 1962). Arguments made in support of small-scale agriculture posit that small, low-input, farm management practices can contribute to greater soil health, which increases water retention during droughts, results in more stable yields in inclement weather, and promotes biodiversity across the landscape (Altieri 2009; Perfecto and Vandermeer 2010; Tscharntke et al. 2012). Many other studies have demonstrated that smaller farms have greater yields than large farms (Sen 1962; Barrett, Bellemare, and Hou 2010b; Henderson 2015), which may help spare land for conservation areas (Maas et al. 2009; Kleijn et al. 2011; Phalan et al. 2011). Notwithstanding these claims, counter-arguments propose smaller farms as less financially viable, with smallholders typically lacking the capital to invest in the on-farm mechanization, irrigation, and crop insurance needed to sustain production throughout prolonged droughts (Fan and Chan-Kang 2005) and increasing global market exposure (Fafchamps 1992; Haji 2007).

Critically, claims by smallholder advocates often conflate the discursive and empirical reasons to support small-scale farmers, which can obfuscate effective policy support for smallholders (Fan and Chan-Kang 2005). For example, during the 2014 United Nations (UN) International Year of the Family Farm, food security agencies called for increased support for ‘small-scale farmers’ (defined as farms < 2 ha), reporting that they produce 70-80% of the world’s food (Maass Wolfenson 2013; Neufeld 2014). But, critics have called this number a gross over-estimate (Graeub et al. 2016; Herrero et al. 2017). Alongside the UN call for action, smallholder advocates posited that the production methods of smallholder systems were more resilient to extreme weather events than large-scale industrial systems (Altieri 2009), but these claims have not been empirically tested with large farms as counterfactuals. 

These contradictions stem from a lack of empirical work that synthesizes the current state of knowledge on the outcomes by farming size, estimates the actual production contributions of smallholders to the global food system, identifies how production methods vary by farm size, assesses how effective these sets of production methods are in bolstering stable yields amidst variable climate, and documents of institutional mechanisms provided to support smallholders while assessing constraints to access these mechanisms. Given that international support for smallholder agriculture has been growing in recent years, and that cogent analysis of farm size remain scarce, discursive claims related to farm size need empirical verification.


#### Dissertation Overview

My dissertation is a multipart and multi-scale study that empirically examines the production, environmental, and socio-economic impacts of farm size and the policy contexts that these impacts operate within. First, the systematic review at the global scale synthesizes empirically derived relationships between farm size and production, environmental, and socio-economic impacts and identifies key research gaps. Second, the global scale analysis provides robust quantitative estimates of how global crop production varies by farm size, in terms of production for food, feed, and other as well as crop diversity. These global scale analyses provide an empirical baseline for international policy calls, such as Sustainable Development Goal 2.3, to be monitored.

Two additional analyses conducted at the national scale used India as a case study. One addressed a key knowledge gap identified by the systematic review (study 1), whether climate variation affects crop production on small farms less than on large farms. Many studies on this topic fail to examine the control case of how large farms perform following temperature or precipitation variation (e.g., drought, flood, heatwave, etc.). Our study examines how the stability of crop production systems to variability in climate varies by farm size.

A second national scale analysis examined the degree of equity in public agricultural support (i.e., testing the notion that larger commercial farms receive the majority of subsidies). The national analysis will examine India’s agricultural support schemes to trace how financial assistance varies by farm size. This study will address one potential explanation for the differential outputs of farm size (i.e., unequal public support), such that smaller farms are financially less viable than large farms due to larger farms receiving most of the public support (e.g., crop insurance, input subsidies, etc.). This study comes at a time when India is enacting its Intended National Domestic Contributions (INDCS from the UN COP21 in Paris), which aims to bolster vulnerable farmers' adaptive capacity to climate change.
